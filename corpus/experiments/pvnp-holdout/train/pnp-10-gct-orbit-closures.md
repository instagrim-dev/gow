# Geometric complexity theory — orbit closures and representation theory (pnp-10)

**Era:** 2001. Anchor: Mulmuley–Sohoni, *Geometric complexity
theory I*, SIAM J. Comput. 31(2), 2001.

GCT is the field's most radical re-representation: recast permanent vs
determinant (an algebraic proxy for NP vs P) as a question about **orbit
closures** under the general linear group action, and seek **representation-
theoretic obstructions** — irreducible modules whose multiplicities
distinguish the two orbit closures.

Mechanistically, GCT is a deliberate response to pnp-08: the sought
obstructions are *rare, highly structured* objects (specific irreducible
representations), not large properties over random truth tables — the program
is explicitly designed to be non-natural. It is also non-relativizing, since
it works with the algebraic anatomy of specific polynomials.

Its recorded status as of 2004 is a **program, not a result**: no
unconditional lower bound for any explicit function had been derived from it,
and the representation-theoretic multiplicity problems it reduces to
(Kronecker coefficients, plethysm) were — and were understood to be — deep
open problems themselves. The structural lesson: escaping
both walls is *possible in posture* (rare, structured, non-black-box), but the
only occupant of that space traded the walls for open problems at
least as hard.
